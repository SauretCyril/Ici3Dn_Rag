# Backend Documentation

This is the backend part of the my-fullstack-app project, which is built using Java and Spring Boot.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/com/example/App.java`: The main entry point of the application.
- `src/main/resources/application.properties`: Configuration properties for the application.
- `pom.xml`: Maven configuration file for managing dependencies and build settings.

## Getting Started

To run the backend application, ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-fullstack-app/backend
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The application will start on the default port (usually 8080). You can change the port and other settings in the `application.properties` file.
