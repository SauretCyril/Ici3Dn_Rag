# Frontend Documentation

## Overview

This is the frontend part of the fullstack application built using TypeScript and React. It serves as the user interface for the application, interacting with the backend services.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the frontend application.
  - `app.ts`: The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing the app and setting up routing.
  - `components/`: Contains React components used in the application.
    - `App.tsx`: The main component that serves as the root of the React application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command in the frontend directory to install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Start the development server with the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Build

To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` directory containing the optimized application files.
